### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Florian Scherf from Hildesheim in Germany. I was born in 94 and
i work as a full stack web developer at [Pengutronix](https://www.pengutronix.de/de/) since 2013.

I do most of my coding in Python. As part of my work at Pengutronix i created
[Flamingo](https://www.flamingo-web.org/), a Pelican inspired static site generator.

In my spare time, I created [Lona](https://lona-web.org), a web framework for responsive
web apps that are written in pure pythonic code, and [rlpython](https://github.com/fscherf/rlpython),
a simple and easy to use Python REPL that can run over Network.
